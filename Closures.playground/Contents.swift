//
// Closures
//

// A closure is just a body of code that can be passed around and used in your code.
let closureAsCode = {
    let player1 = "Player1"
    let computer = "Computer"
    
    print(player1.count > computer.count ? "\(player1) wins!" : "Game Over!")
}

// Which can be executed like this
closureAsCode()

// We can define them as variables...
let closureAsVariable = { print("I'm a closure!") }
closureAsVariable

// ...methods
func printer(payload: String) { // nothing more than a function
    print(payload)
}

// and even pass them as variables to other methods
func printIt(closure: (String) -> String) -> Void {
    let message = "Hello old friend!"
    closure(message) // And execute
}

printIt(closure: { _ in return "Imprimindo..." } )

// Closures have type

// a closure that has no parameters and return a String
var hello: () -> (String) = {
    return "Hello!"
}
hello()

// but you don't need to include
var hello2 = {
    return "Hello again!"
}
hello2()

// a closure that take one Int and return a Int
var double: (Int) -> (Int) = { x in
    return 2 * x
}
double(4) // 8

// you can pass closures in your code, for example, to other variables
var alsoDouble = double
alsoDouble(5) // 10

// Closures are first class citizens in Swift (variables, functions, return types)
// - asynchronous network calls
// - as a means of passing around processing
// - also make our code easier to read and reason about

// Example - Array has a method called sort that takes a function (as a closure) and uses it to compare elements.
/// func sorted(by areIncreadingOrder: (Element, Element) -> Bool) -> [Element]

// Instead of trying to come up with every permutation and combination of users would want to compare
// it defines a closure, as a type, and let's you write whatever comparison logic you want yourself.

/// func sorted((Element, Element) -> Bool) -> [Element]
/// func backward((String, String) -> Bool) -> [String]

let names = ["Chris", "Alex", "Ewa", "Barry", "Daniella"]

// We can define a function matching that signature...
func backward(_ s1: String, _ s2: String) -> Bool {
    return s1 > s2 // define our logic (as a closure)
}

// and then pass that in and use it to sort the names in our array
let reversedNames = names.sorted(by: backward)

// Swift has a lot of shortcuts for how to write closures more tersely (matter of style and choice).

// Closure inlined
let reversedNames2 = names.sorted(by: {(s1: String, s2: String) -> Bool in
    return s1 > s2
})

// Inferring type from context
let reversedNames3 = names.sorted(by: {s1, s2 in return s1 > s2})

// Implicit return from single-expression
let reversedNames4 = names.sorted(by: {s1, s2 in s1 > s2})

// Shorthand $0 and $1
let reversedNames5 = names.sorted(by: {$0 > $1})

// Trailing Closures
let reversedNames6 = names.sorted() {$0 > $1}

// Operator method that match our function signature
let reversedNames7 = names.sorted(by: >)

// Ready Player 1 - Shortfirst
//
// Using the Array.sorted() method, write a closure that sorts the Array based on length of string
let cars = ["Audi", "Ferrari", "Bugatti", "Mercedes", "BMW", "Aston-Martin", "Porsche", "Mclaren"]
//
func shortFirst(_ s1: String, _ s2: String) -> Bool {
    s2.count > s1.count
}

let shortWords = cars.sorted(by: shortFirst)
print(shortWords)

let shortWords2 = cars.sorted(by: {s1, s2 in s2.count > s1.count})
print(shortWords2)

// - Ready Player 1 - Trailing Closures
//
// Inline this method using any of the methods described above
//
let shortWords3 = cars.sorted() { $1.count > $0.count }
print(shortWords3)

// Map, Filter, Reduce - aka Higher Order Functions
//
// A higher order function is a function that does at least one of the following:
// - takes a function as an input
// - return a function as the output

// Swift has three important higher order function implemented for arrays: map, filter and reduce
//
// Map - Transforms an array using a function
//
// One way
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
var strings = [String]()
for number in numbers {
    strings.append("\(number)")
}

// But a better way
var strings1 = numbers.map {"\($0)"}
print(strings1)

//
// Filter - Selects the elements of an array which satisfy a certain condition
//

var evenNumbers = numbers.filter { num in
    num % 2 == 0
}
print(evenNumbers)

// Using trailing closures
var evenNumbers1 = numbers.filter { $0 % 2 == 0 }
print(evenNumbers1)

//
// Reduce - Combines all the values from an array into a single value
//
var numbers1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
var result = numbers1.reduce(0) { $0 + $1 }
print(result)
